Current configuration is for the test on zone1 (La courneuve)
Objective: Optimizing COS while satisfying all the others

Implimented rules:
Article 6: (1) Distance to front border: d>=3m;(2) All buildings are parallel to front border.
Article 7: (1) Distances to two side borders d1, d2 satisfy: d1=0 && d_2=0 || d1=0 && d2>=max(6,h) || d1>=max(6,h) && d2=0. (2) Distance to back border d>=4m.
Article 8: Distance between each two buildings: d>=4
Article 9: CES<=0.6
Article 10: Height h [6,18]
Article 14: COS<=3

ps: rules are slightly different from the provided rules from QV
